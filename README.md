## Project Overview
The **SkyInsight Weather Classifier** is a tool that leverages weather data to classify various weather types, such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc. This is achieved by using machine learning algorithms, particularly focusing on accurate weather classification based on historical data. 

The project is structured around a Jupyter notebook to ensure ease of experimentation, training, and visualizing results.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Classification Models**: Implements and compares multiple classifiers (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, k-NN).
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance.
- **Visualization**: Uses libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical insights into the dataset and model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammedtaha78/World-Weather-Repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd World-Weather-Repository
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the project, simply open the Jupyter notebook:
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `SkyInsight_Weather_Classifier.ipynb` notebook.
